							<h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a current full time student at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Systems program. Before registering for the ITS program in the University of Texas at Dallas, I was a full time Senior Pharmacy Technician with 10 years of experience. You may be thinking "wait, how did you transition from being a Pharmacy Technician to studying Information Technology?" and I am delighted that you asked! I have always been fascinated by technology and have developed great interest in the maintenance and trouble shooting of my personal gadgets. After my High School graduation I was offered the opportunity to work in the healthcare field and at the time, I simply couldn't refuse. Now that I can finally afford to pursue higher education (which is insanely expensive), I've decided to re-ignite my childhood dream of working with tech and helping others.</p>

								<h3>Denton Regional Medical Center</h3>
								<p>My very first Pharmacy Technician experience. Susan Dianne Blankenship, the Pharmacy Director at the time, gave me my first opportunity to become a Pharmacy Technician and allowed me to train with her team while I was attaining my Pharmacy Technician certification from the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. She was one of the most respected directors Denton Regional has ever seen. I deeply admired her and so did everyone I've worked with, and I am truly thankful and honored to have worked with her.  </p>
